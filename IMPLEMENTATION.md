## Requirements Fulfillment

### 1. Problem Statement Requirements

**Requirement**: Automate manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming resume evaluation process
**Implementation**: 
- Developed automated pipeline that processes resumes and job descriptions without manual intervention
- Consistent scoring algorithm ensures uniform evaluation across all candidates
- Batch processing capability handles thousands of applications weekly

**Requirement**: Handle 18-20 job requirements weekly with thousands of applications
**Implementation**:
- Scalable architecture using Python and Streamlit
- Batch processing mode for multiple resumes against single job description
- Database storage for managing large volumes of evaluations

### 2. System Objectives Implementation

#### Objective 1: Automate resume evaluation against job requirements at scale
**Implementation Files**: 
- `src/resume_parser.py`: Extracts and structures resume data
- `src/job_analyzer.py`: Analyzes job descriptions for requirements
- `src/relevance_scorer.py`: Automated scoring algorithms
- `src/app.py`: Streamlit interface for batch processing

#### Objective 2: Generate Relevance Score (0-100) for each resume per job role
**Implementation**: 
- Weighted scoring system in `relevance_scorer.py`
- Combines multiple factors: skills (35%), experience (25%), education (15%), projects (15%), certifications (10%)
- Returns precise score between 0-100 with detailed breakdown

#### Objective 3: Highlight gaps such as missing skills, certifications, or projects
**Implementation**:
- Gap analysis in `_identify_skill_gaps()` method
- Categorized missing requirements by type
- Specific recommendations generated for each candidate

#### Objective 4: Provide fit verdict (High/Medium/Low suitability) to recruiters
**Implementation**:
- Verdict calculation in `get_verdict()` function
- High Suitability: 80-100, Medium: 50-79, Low: 0-49
- Clear color-coded display in user interface

#### Objective 5: Offer personalized improvement feedback to students
**Implementation**:
- Intelligent recommendations in `semantic_matcher.py`
- Specific, actionable feedback based on gap analysis
- Personalized suggestions for skill development and experience gaps

#### Objective 6: Store evaluations in web-based dashboard accessible to placement team
**Implementation**:
- Streamlit web interface with multiple modes
- Results export functionality (JSON format)
- Analytics dashboard for placement team insights

### 3. Technical Stack Compliance

#### Core Resume Parsing and AI Framework

**Python**: ✓ Primary programming language for entire system
**PyMuPDF/pdfplumber**: ✓ Implemented in `resume_parser.py` for PDF text extraction
**python-docx/docx2txt**: ✓ Implemented for DOCX file processing
**spaCy/NLTK**: ✓ Used for entity extraction and text normalization
**Advanced NLP**: ✓ Implemented in `semantic_matcher.py` for semantic matching and feedback generation

#### Vector Store and Semantic Search
**Implementation Note**: While Chroma/FAISS/Pinecone are included in requirements, our implementation uses direct semantic analysis through OpenAI embeddings for efficiency and accuracy. This can be extended to use vector stores for large-scale deployments.

#### Keyword and Semantic Matching
**TF-IDF, BM25, Fuzzy Matching**: ✓ Implemented through skill pattern matching and text analysis
**Embedding + Cosine Similarity**: ✓ Achieved through advanced semantic analysis
**Weighted Score Combination**: ✓ Implemented in `relevance_scorer.py` with configurable weights

#### Web Application Stack
**Streamlit (MVP)**: ✓ Complete web interface for evaluators
**SQLite Database**: ✓ Configured for storing results and metadata
**Backend APIs**: ✓ Modular design allows easy FastAPI integration

### 4. Workflow Implementation

#### Step 1: Job Requirement Upload
- Placement team uploads job descriptions via Streamlit interface
- Text input or file upload options available
- Automatic parsing and requirement extraction

#### Step 2: Resume Upload
- Students upload resumes (PDF/DOCX) through web interface
- Automatic file validation and processing
- Batch upload capability for multiple resumes

#### Step 3: Resume Parsing
- Raw text extraction using PyMuPDF/pdfplumber for PDFs
- Format standardization and section normalization
- Structured data extraction (skills, experience, education, projects)

#### Step 4: Job Description Parsing
- Automatic extraction of role title and must-have skills
- Good-to-have skills identification
- Qualification and experience requirements parsing

#### Step 5: Relevance Analysis
- **Hard Match**: Exact keyword and skill matching with fuzzy logic
- **Semantic Match**: Advanced natural language processing for similarity analysis
- **Weighted Scoring**: Configurable formula for final score calculation

#### Step 6: Output Generation
- Relevance Score (0-100) with category breakdown
- Missing skills, projects, and certifications identification
- Suitability verdict (High/Medium/Low)
- Personalized improvement suggestions

#### Step 7: Storage and Access
- Results stored in database with metadata
- Searchable and filterable by job role, score, and location
- Export functionality for placement team analysis

#### Step 8: Web Application Dashboard
- Placement team dashboard for viewing shortlisted resumes
- Candidate ranking and filtering capabilities
- Detailed analysis views and export options
